            <p>Based in Vancouver, BC, we provide positive behaviour support (PBS) services to families and schools with children that engage in various forms of problem behaviour, regardless of whether or not they have a formal diagnosis. Our team has experience working with children with anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and intellectual disabilities.</p>

              <label>Examples might include:</label>

              <div class="row">
                <div class="sm-med-6 columns">

              <p class="sep">These and other problem behaviours often emerge early on in home and school life and remain persistent and pervasive. Problem behaviour does not just go away and many children do not outgrow their challenges without intervention. Problem behaviour negatively affects the quality of life of the child, family, and school community. Children who engage in problem behaviour are more likely to miss out on learning activities, be socially isolated from family and peers, and are less likely to participate in community activities.</p>

                  <p class="important">We aim to develop positive behaviour support (PBS) plans in collaboration with families and school teams. </p>

                  <p>Our PBS approach incorporates the assessment of the functions of problem behaviour, the analysis of adult-child interactions, and an understanding of the contextual and ecological elements of a family’s or school’s daily routines. These three levels of analysis provide for a comprehensive understanding of why problem behaviour occurs and promotes the development of <strong>effective</strong>, <strong>acceptable</strong>, <strong>sustainable</strong>, and <strong>durable</strong> interventions.</p>

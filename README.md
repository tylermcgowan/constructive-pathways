# Constructive Pathways Website

## Version 1.0
Initial version developed by Jamie Chong, designed by Cedar. Small revisions are required before going live, so the dev site is moving from [cp.hippocurious.com](http://cp.hippocurious.com) to [cp.cedarmade.co](http://cp.cedarmade.co) I have some revisions to make, so adding the site here to track changes in the case I need to revert.
